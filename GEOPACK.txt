  Below is a package of codes and texts received from Kolya Tsyganenko a 
week and a half ago.  The model is the T89 model, but the coefficients are 
newly derived including ISEE 1-2 data in the tail, which give a much better
Bz, without "islands" and about twice the value of the old models, which
was found inaccurate by Cheryl Huang.  The model was derived by Kolya.

                           INTRODUCTION

	Configuration of the magnetic field in the near-Earth space is
believed to be one of the most important characteristics of human 
environment. The geomagnetic field links the interplanetary medium 
with the Earth's upper atmosphere and the ionosphere and determi-
nes the trajectories of the solar energetic protons ejected during so-
lar flares, low-frequency electromagnetic wave and heat flux, auroral
electron precipitation during substorms, distribution of the trapped 
radiation belt particles, etc.  Investigations of these phenomena are
closely related to the problem of forecasting the "weather" in the 
near-Earth space which determines the conditions of the radiowave pro-
pagation, safety of manned space flights, reliability of satellite 
systems of communication, navigation, weather forecasts, monitoring
the Earth's surface from space, and so on.
        For this reason it is of great importance to develop tools for 
computing the structure of the geomagnetic field which take into acco-
unt the level of magnetospheric disturbance and other factors defining
temporal changes of near-Earth electric current systems. In practical
geophysical applications it is often necessary to compute the compo-
nents of the geomagnetic field vector in a large range of geocentric 
distances and to trace the field lines from the Earth's surface to re-
mote regions of the magnetosphere and backwards. This requires to take 
into account both the contribution from the Earth's internal magnetic 
field sources and the external electric current systems defined by the 
effects of the solar wind. 
        This set of subroutines computes the geomagnetic field compo-
nents at any arbitrary point of space between the Earth's surface and
the Moon's orbit and traces the force lines passing through any given 
point, taking into account the degree of magnetospheric disturbance.
It also contains subsidiary codes for transformations between the co-
ordinate systems most widely used in geophysics and space physics.
        The set contains the subroutines EX89KP and EX89AE which cor-
respond to the last version of the magnetospheric magnetic field mo-
dels based on 36682 vector averages obtained from IMP-A,C,D,E,F,G,H,
and J  and HEOS-1 and -2 spacecraft measurements taken within the 
cislunar magnetospheric domain (R < 70 Earth radii) during 1966-1980  
(Tsyganenko, 1989).
        The set of subroutines was developed originally in 1978 and
since then had been applied by users in Leningrad University and 
other USSR institutions for solving various geophysical problems.  
The present version of the GEOPACK set was prepared with an account 
of all the experience accumulated by the author himself during the 
last decade as well as of critical comments of his colleagues.



                DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SUBROUTINES



     1. SUBROUTINE:   IGRF

        FUNCTION:     Computes three spherical components of the main
geomagnetic field in the geographical coordinate system (GEO).

        FORTRAN STATEMENT:   CALL IGRF(IY,NM,R,T,F,BR,BT,BF)

        INPUT PARAMETERS:    IY is year (four digits) which should be
specified in the interval 1965 <= IY <= 1990;  NM  is the maximal or-
der of spherical harmonics to be taken into account in the correspon-
ding expansions (1<=NM<=10);  R,T,F  are spherical coordinates of the
point (radial geocentric distance in Earth radii Re=6371.2 km, colati-
tude, and east longitude in radians, respectively).

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:  BR,BT, BF are the spherical components of
main geomagnetic field in nanotesla.

        COMMON BLOCKS:  none.

        REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES: none.

        COMMENTS:   The subroutine uses harmonic coefficients for five
epochs: 1965.0, 1970.0, 1975.0, 1980.0, and 1985.0.  It calculates the
current values of coefficients by means of linear interpolation between
the nearest epochs or extrapolates by using secular coefficients in ca-
se of IY<1965 or IY>1985.




     2. SUBROUTINE:  DIP

        FUNCTION:  Computes Cartesian solar-magnetospheric (GSM) com-
ponents of the Earth's magnetic field corresponding to the first (dipo-
lar) term in the spherical  harmonic expansion.

        FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL DIP(PS,X,Y,Z,BX,BY,BZ)

        INPUT PARAMETERS:  PS is the angle in radians between the dipo-
le moment axis and the ZGSM axis (PS<0 in winter and PS>0 in summer);

        COMMENTS: (1) The dipole is considered to be centered at the
origin; the value of its magnetic moment corresponds to the epoch
1980.0 (N.W. Peddie, 1982).
                   (2) The angle PS can be either specified directly,
or calculated by using the subroutine RECALC; in the last case the
unlabelled COMMON block should be present in the module from which
RECALC and DIP are called. The value of the dipole tilt angle (in ra-
dians) will be placed by RECALC in the 16-th element of the COMMON-
block.


      3. SUBROUTINE: SUN

of the Sun (all in radians), respectively.

         COMMON BLOCKS:  none.

         REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES: none.

         COMMENTS:  (1) 1901<IYR<2099
                     (2) January 1 corresponds to IDAY=1
                     (3) The subroutine was compiled (with minor changes)
from the paper by C.T. Russell (1971).



      4. SUBROUTINE:  SPHCAR

         FUNCTION:  Computes spherical coordinates from Cartesian ones
or vica versa.

         FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL SPHCAR(R,TETA,PHI,X,Y,Z,J)

         INPUT PARAMETERS:  J is the integer key parameter: if J>0 then
spherical coordinates R,TETA,PHI are the input quantities (colatitude
TETA and longitude PHI are in radians); if J<0 then Cartesian coordinates
X,Y,Z are the inputs.

         OUTPUT PARAMETERS:  If J>0 then Cartesian coordinates X,Y,Z;

to 0.



      5. SUBROUTINE:  BSPCAR

         FUNCTION:  Calculation of Cartesian components of a vector from

         INPUT PARAMETERS:  TETA and PHI are the colatitude and longitude
of the point in radians; BR,BTET, and BPHI are the vector components in
the local coordinate system.

         OUTPUT PARAMETERS: BX,BY,BZ are Cartesian components of the vec-
tor.
         COMMON BLOCKS: none.

         REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES: none.



      6. SUBROUTINE: RECALC

         FUNCTION:  Computes the angles defining the geodipole orientati-
on for a given UT moment as well as elements of matrices for transformati-
ons between the following Cartesian geocentric coordinate systems:
geographic (GEO), dipole geomagnetic (MAG), solar-magnetic (SM), solar-
magnetospheric (GSM), solar-ecliptical (GSE).

         FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL RECALC(IYR,IDAY,IHOUR,MIN,ISEC)

         COMMON BLOCKS:  the results are placed in the unlabeled common
block containing 37 words.

         COMMENTS:  If it is necessary to make calculations only in the
coordinate systems GEO and MAG (no UT dependence) then the parameter
IHOUR can be assigned a value larger than 24; in this case other matri-
ces will not be defined.




      7. SUBROUTINE:  GEOMAG.

         FUNCTION:  Transformation of the geographic Cartesian coordina-
tes into the dipolar geomagnetic ones and vica versa.

         FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL GEOMAG(XGEO,YGEO,ZGEO,XMAG,YMAG,ZMAG,
                                J,IYR)

         INPUT PARAMETERS:  J is the integer key parameter: if J>0 then
the geographic Cartesian coordinates XGEO,YGEO,ZGEO are the inputs;

           FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL GEOGSM(XGEO,YGEO,ZGEO,XGSM,YGSM,ZGSM,J)

           INPUT PARAMETERS:  J is the integer key parameter: if J>0 then
the geographic Cartesian coordinates XGEO,YGEO,ZGEO are the inputs;

           REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES:  none.



       12. SUBROUTINE:  RHAND.

           FUNCTION: This is a subsidiary subroutine which computes the
right-hand sides of the field line equations (that is, the components of
the unit vector defining the local direction of B) which are necessary
for making one step along the field line made by the subroutine STEP.

           FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL RHAND(X,Y,Z,R1,R2,R3,IOPT,EXNAME)

           INPUT PARAMETERS:  X,Y,Z  are GSM Cartesian coordinates of
the current point of space, IOPT is the number of the option of the ex-
ternal magnetic field model; EXNAME is the name of an external field
model subroutine  (see below the description of the subroutine TRACE
for more details).

            OUTPUT PARAMETERS:  R1,R2,R3 are the right-hand-side quan-
tities (the unit vector components).

            COMMON BLOCKS: the same as in RECALC.

            REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES: DIP, EXNAME, IGRF, GEOGSM,
                                            SPHCAR, BSPCAR.



        13. SUBROUTINE: STEP.

           FUNCTION:  Makes one step along the force line of the magne-
tic field corresponding to the sum of contributions from internal and
external sources computed by the subroutines IGRF (or DIP) and EXNAME,
respectively.

           FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL STEP(N,X,Y,Z,DS,ERRIN,IOPT,EXNAME)

           INPUT PARAMETERS:  N is the maximal order of spherical harmo-
nics in the main field expansions; X,Y,Z  are GSM coordinates of the
initial point; DS is the step size; ERRIN is the estimate of the admis-
sible error; IOPT is the number of the option of the external magnetic
field model; EXNAME is the name of an external field model subroutine
(see below the description of the subroutine TRACE for more details).

           OUTPUT PARAMETERS:  X,Y,Z are GSM coordinates of the next
point on the traced field line (after making one step).

           COMMON BLOCKS: the same as in RECALC.

           REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES:  RHAND.

           COMMENTS:  (1) If the subroutine is used separately (that is,
called not via the subroutine TRACE), then it is necessary to specify
the actual name of the subroutine EXNAME in the FORTRAN statement
EXTERNAL in the module , from which STEP is to be called (see also com-
ments 1-3 for the subroutine TRACE).
                     (2) The parameter DS can change its value after
having called STEP, since in case of too large actual error (that is,
exceeding ERRIN) the step is repeated once again with the halved value
of DS; if the actual error appears to be much smaller (less than 4 per-
cent) than ERRIN, then the step is not repeated, but the value of DS
for the next step is doubled.



       14. SUBROUTINE:  TRACE.

           FUNCTION:  Computation of GSM coordinates of points lying on
the geomagnetic field line, beginning from a given initial point, up to
its intersection  with the inner or the outer spherical boundaries of
the tracing region.

           FORTRAN STATEMENT:  CALL TRACE(XI,YI,ZI,DIR,RLIM,R0,IHARM,NP,
                                  IOPT,EXNAME,XF,YF,ZF,XX,YY,ZZ,L)

           INPUT PARAMETERS:  XI,YI,ZI, are the GSM coordinates of the
initial point (in Earth's radii); DIR defines the tracing direction:
for DIR=1.0 it is opposite to that of the B vector, and for DIR=-1.0
it coincides with B direction. Parameter RLIM is the radius of spheri-
cal outer boundary of the tracing region (in Earth's radii), so that
the tracing is ceased once R>RLIM;  R0 is the radius of the inner sphe-
rical boundary of the tracing region (usually R0=1.0, which corresponds
to the Earth's surface; see also the comment No.4); IHARM is the maxi-
mal order of spherical harmonics taken into account in computing the
main part of the B-field (see the comment No.2); NP is the upper esti-
mate for the expected number of steps along the field line segment;
IOPT is the number of the option of the external magnetic field model
(see the description of the corresponding subroutine); EXNAME is any
name of a subroutine that returns the components of the magnetic field 
contributed by the external sources. The corresponding actual parameter
should have the type CHARACTER*n (n is the total number of symbols) and
must be specified in the EXTERNAL statement of the main module. The
list of formal parameters of the subroutine EXNAME must be as follows:
 (IOPT, PS, X, Y, Z, BX, BY, BZ), where IOPT is an integer number reserved
for specifying a concrete version of the external field model (e.g. the
KP-index), the other 6 parameters are identical to those in the subroutine 
DIP.
   See an example of using this subroutine in the end of the file
GEOPACK.FOR for more details.

           COMMON BLOCKS:  the same as in RECALC.

           REFERENCES TO OTHER SUBROUTINES: STEP, RHAND.

           COMMENTS:  (1) Before making field line computations for
concrete geophysical situations it is necessary to specify some quan-
tities defining relative orientation of geographical and solar-magne-
tospheric coordinate systems. This should be done by having called the
subroutine  RECALC with appropriate values of parameters defining year,
day, and UT moment. In this case it is recommended to take IHARM from
7 to 10, bearing in mind that actual length of the corresponding expan-
sions will be set automatically by the subroutine in dependence on the
current value of the geocentric distance and falls off rapidly with in-
creasing R.
                     (2) If the dipolar approximation for the main B-
field is sufficient, then it is possible to set IHARM=0; in this case
the subroutine DIP will be used instead of IGRF, and the computations
will run much more rapidly. The corresponding value of the dipole tilt
angle should be specified before tracing by putting it (in radians) in
the 16-th element of the unlabelled COMMON-block. Another possibility
is to set IHARM=1 and call RECALC before tracing; in this case the
tilt angle and other quantities necessary for coordinate transformati-
ons are calculated automatically from the year, day, and UT values.

                     (3) Any other external field model subroutine
can be used; the only necessary condition is that it  has the same
list of formal parameters and its name be included in the EXTERNAL
statement in the program module which calls TRACE.

                     (4) If the field line returns to the Earth, then
the last (L-th) elements in the arrays XX,YY,ZZ as well as the triplet
XF,YF,ZF  correspond to the intersection point of the line with the
sphere of radius R0.
                     (5) If L<NP then the rest (NP-L) elements of 
XX,YY,ZZ are filled with the values of the final point coordinates 
(XF,YF,ZF). If L>NP (that is, not enough space reserved for the 
computation results) then the computation is aborted and a warning 
diagnostics is displayed. In most cases, it is enough to take NP of 
the order of 300.
